In the years 2016 - 2022, numerous aerial surveys with different drones and sensors were carried out in the Marburg University Forest.  The focus was on low-budget equipment, i.e. off-the-shelf consumer drones with RGB cameras or action cameras like the GoPro or gitup/mapir. There were also individual flights with the Altum sensor and the L1 Zenmuse. 
This data and the products can be found on the [MOF droneDB web server](http://137.248.191.201:5000/r/mof).
