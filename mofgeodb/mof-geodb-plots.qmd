# Survey Plots

### Forest Structure -- fs
Plots for surveying forest structure are setup by various student groups since 2017. The decision where to set up a plot follows no random or systematic scheme (what a pitty!) but is somehow accidental.

General characteristics are:
* circular 10m radius in horizontal plane
* slope
* aspect
* remarks on special items

All plots are marked with a central point (stored in `topopoint`, see figure \@ref(fig:benchmark-fig)).

```{r benchmark-fig, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Benchmark', fig.alt='Benchmark'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/benchmark.png")
```

On the plot following items are surveyed depending on time:
* coordinates of all trees from 7 cm dbh
* species
* dbh
* optional
  * height
  * micro habitats
  * vitality
  * social position
  
A plot from data out of MOFgeoDB is shown in figure \@ref(fig:fs-plot-fig).

```{r fs-plot-fig, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='fs-004 as example for the visualization of the plot data in QGIS.', fig.alt='Example of fs-plot'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fs-004_plotExample.png")
```
In real the plot looks something like this:
```{r fs-004-summerPano-fig, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Panoramic view of fs-004 in summer.', fig.alt='Summer pano of fs-004'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fs-004_summerPano.jpg")
```

All plots are visited sporadically. The locations are shown in figure XXX

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(mapview)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
# load plots
plots <- st_read("https://github.com/MarburgOpenForest/MOFGeoDB/blob/master/MOFgeoDB.sqlite?raw=true", quiet = T, layer = "vw_plot_fs")

plots %>% 
  mapview(
    map.types = "OpenStreetMap", 
    color = "grey20",
    lwd = 1,
    label = plots$plot_id,
    layer.name = "fs-plots")
```
